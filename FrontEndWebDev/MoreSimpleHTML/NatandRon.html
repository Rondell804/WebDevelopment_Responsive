              <p>Natalie and Rondell were fortunate to meet at Rondell's co-worker wedding in May of last year. The couple since then continued to pursue each other by going on dinner dates, miniture golf, and other fun activites. While dating they loved calling each other to talk on the phone for hours. They also went on my mini trips to Chicago to visit family and friends. The lovely couple then knew that real love is floating in the air. Want to know more about the two indivisually.
              </p>
              <p>Natalie is a very energetic person with alot of words of life within her. Her demeanor is to be the best person anyone will know and the hardest working person alive. She takes life very seriously and treating people correctly. Natalie loves to <b><em>Travel, Travel, Travel</em></b> across the globe to continue to cross off destinations on her bucket list.
              </p>
              <p>Rondell can be considered as a quiet person until he gets to know an individual. His kindness is unreal and he cherishes his family over everything. He loves long walks on the beach and learning new technology. Seeing new innovative technology gives him a reason to live and strive for better in life. Rondell loves his daughter and his wife Natalie! Yes, the two have gotten engaged and are happily married now.
